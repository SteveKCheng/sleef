/* 
  Version script for GNU LD-compatible linkers,
  to define the version node "SLEEF_3" that contains
  the scalar functions from Sleef re-exported under
  C99 names.  

  We must use versioned symbols so that, if a process 
  loads both libsleef.so and libm.so (the C99 math 
  functions from the standard C library), the two
  implementations of the functions will not clash
  with each other.

  This version script is used only when the EXPORT_C99
  feature is turned on in Sleef's CMake build system.
